<br/>

Foreign environment wraps application execution in a way that environment variables that are exported or modified get imported back into fish. This makes possible running popular bash scripts, like the excellent `nvm`.


# Install

Be sure to have [Oh My Fish][omf-link] installed, so you just need to:

```fish
omf install foreign-env
```

If you dislike shell frameworks, you can still use Foreign Environment in Fish! Clone this repo somewhere and append to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
set fish_function_path $fish_function_path <insert path to foreign-env repo>/functions
```


# Usage examples

You can use bash syntax to export variables:

```fish
fenv export PYTHON=python2
```

This will have the same effect as typing:

```fish
set -g -x PYTHON python2
```

You can also call multiple commands, separated by semicolon:

```fish
fenv source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh \; nvm --help
```

When commands aren't double quoted, you need to escape semicolon with slash `\;` to prevent fish from interpreting it. Or just quote the whole command:

```fish
fenv "source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh; nvm --help"
```

You can also choose to print the output instead of setting the environment:

```fish
fenv -p export PYTHON=python2
```

will print

```fish
set -g -x PYTHON python2
```

instead of executing the command. This can be used to translate a foreign environment file to a native fish file.


# Caveats

* Currently we only handle environment variables that are added or modified. If a variable is unset (removed from environment) it will not be removed from fish.
